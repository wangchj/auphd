%Skyline is a popular query type which retrieves data objects that are not dominated by any other object with respect to multiple attributes. Skyline queries have broad applications; however, limited studies have been done on skyline in the broadcast data model. No study has been done on flexible skyline query evaluations in this model that can handle a combination of minimum and maximum attributes. In this paper, we propose the depth-first distributed index (DFDI) and the skyline algorithms that incorporate DFDI to efficiently evaluate skyline in broadcast environments. Our extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms can answer skyline queries in broadcast environments effectively and efficiently.
