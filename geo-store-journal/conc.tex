
The increasing amount of RDF data containing location-based
information calls for the development of systems which support
effective evaluation of location-based services on RDF triple
stores. In our Geo-Store project, we implement a system which is
capable of querying heterogenous data sources and providing
semantics-enabled location-based services with high efficiency.
The Geo-Store system confers the following advantages. First,
Geo-Store utilizes Spatially Aware Mapping to preserve spatial
locality during encoding. Second, as our experiments demonstrate,
Geo-Store allows for effective processing of range and $k$NN
queries. Third, existing triple stores can be easily integrated
with Geo-Store with limited integration cost. In the future, we
plan to extend Geo-Store to support other novel RDF query
languages specifically designed for spatial data management, such
as GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL, by expanding the query parser module
and related components. In addition, we will support more spatial
query types, such as spatial join, in the next phase of this
project.
