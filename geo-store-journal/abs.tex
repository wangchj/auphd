
Today, location-based services (LBS) are very popular information
services for mobile users who access the services with
location-aware mobile devices through wireless networks. The data
sources of advanced LBSs are on the Web, which consists of a huge
volume of data in human-readable format. The main goal of the
Semantic Web is to augment the Web with information so that
computers can understand and exchange Web data. Therefore, it will
be a trend for LBS providers to employ Semantic Web data sources
to develop semantics-enabled location-based services. However,
there are currently limited solutions to process spatial queries,
the building blocks of most LBSs, on Semantic Web data for
supporting location-based services. This article describes our
novel spatial query techniques, which are able to efficiently
evaluate spatial queries on RDF triple stores (Semantic Web data
management systems) for providing semantics-enabled location-based
services.
