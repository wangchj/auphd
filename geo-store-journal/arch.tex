Although many RDF triple stores have been proposed during the past few years, most of them were designed and optimized mainly for non-spatial Semantic Web data. In order to enable spatial query processing on RDF triple stores, the state-of-the-art method~\cite{conf/gis/BrodtNM10} is to treat all the Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) and literals, non-spatial or spatial, equally and replace each URI and literal with an integer ID by dictionary encoding. As a result, each spatial literal (e.g., the latitude and longitude coordinates or the address) is mapped to a randomly generated ID. Afterwards, an R-tree (or its variant)~\cite{reference/gis/HadjieleftheriouMTT08} is created to index all the IDs referred to spatial literals. However, this dictionary encoding-based method may incur extreme inefficiency in evaluating spatial queries on RDF triple stores, especially when coping with large-scale spatial data sets~\cite{conf/gis/BrodtNM10}. In this chapter, we employ a novel representation, \emph{GeoHilbert} -- an RDF vocabulary as an extension of the Geography Markup Language (GML), to model spatial features based on their Hilbert curve~\cite{journals/tkde/MoonJFS01} transformation information and to utilize Spatially Aware Mapping (SAM), instead of dictionary mapping, to encode URIs and literals for preserving spatial locality.

\subsection{Data Representation}

Because many huge data repositories published online contain geographic location or spatial relationship information, we are witnessing a new research trend of modeling geographic entities ontologically and querying their spatial relations in the Semantic Web community. As one of the Semantic Web technologies, the Resource Description Framework treats relationships as first-class citizens and, consequently, can work as an ideal tool for modeling and querying complex and large amounts of relations between spatial entities. The XML formatted semantic data can be converted to the corresponding RDF representation with minor modifications. For example, Listing~\ref{list2} shows an XML data excerpt from the OpenStreetMap project\footnote{http://www.openstreetmap.org/}. This snippet describes the referred information (semantic and spatial) about a restaurant in Pasadena, California, USA. Its corresponding RDF representation is demonstrated in Listing~\ref{list3}. Specifically, \emph{gml} represents the namespace\footnote{http://www.opengis.net/gml} of the GML standard, and \emph{gstore} corresponds to the namespace\footnote{http://example.org/gstore} of our Geo-Store system.

%The RDF data is a collection of RDF triples, and each RDF triple
%is of the form $\langle subject, predicate, object \rangle$, where
%\emph{subject} is the URI of a resource, \emph{predicate}
%represents a particular relationship, and \emph{object} denotes a
%URI of another resource or a literal.

\subsection{System Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig-framework} shows the system framework of the
Geo-Store system, which consists of four main components: query
parser and planner module, spatially aware mapping module,
internal processing module, and dictionary decoding module.

\subsubsection{Spatially Aware Mapping Module}

In most of the existing triple stores, each URI or literal is replaced with a unique integer ID by dictionary mapping because the triples may contain very long URIs and string literals. In our system, in order to support efficient spatial query evaluation on triples, we extend the standard dictionary encoding and design a Spatially Aware Mapping (SAM) approach to encode all the URIs and literals, as well as preserve spatial locality. SAM includes two major components, \emph{GeoHilbert Transformation} and \emph{Discriminative Encoding}. With GeoHilbert Transformation, original RDF triples are transformed to the corresponding GeoHilbert representation. In addition, SAM assigns an ID to each URI and literal in a discriminative way in order to maintain spatial locality by executing the discriminative encoding component.

\paragraph{GeoHilbert Transformation}

We utilize a novel RDF representation, GeoHilbert, to model spatial data in Geo-Store. GeoHilbert is designed for incorporating the Hilbert curve-based spatial transformation information into original RDF data. GeoHilbert consists of a subject, \emph{HilbertMapping} and four predicates: \emph{StartPoint}, \emph{Order}, \emph{Orientation}, and \emph{Pos}. Specifically, the values of \emph{StartPoint}, \emph{Order}, \emph{Orientation}, and \emph{Pos} are the location of the Hilbert curve starting point, the curve order $O$, the curve orientation $\theta$, and a Hilbert value translated from a given spatial location, respectively.

Listing~\ref{list4} demonstrates the corresponding RDF data in the
GeoHilbert representation for the restaurant described in
Listing~\ref{list2}. As shown in Listings~\ref{list3}
and~\ref{list4}, the GeoHilbert representation appends to the
original RDF representation an additional RDF statement,
\{\emph{gstore:Point738330640}, \emph{gstore:Pos},
\emph{``208083"}\}, which stores the relative position of the
referred point along the Hilbert space-filling curve.

...
\end{lstlisting}


\paragraph{Discriminative Encoding}

The Discriminative Encoding (DE) component takes the GeoHilbert representation based data as the input. For each literal following the predicate \emph{Pos}, DE assigns it a positive ID which is exactly the same as its Hilbert value. For example, in Listing~\ref{list4}, the literal \emph{``208083"} in the triple \{\emph{gstore:Point738330640}, \emph{gstore:Pos}, \emph{``208083"}\} will be assigned with ID \emph{208083}. For all the other literals or URIs, DE acquires a random integer by calling a dictionary encoding function, and then returns the opposite of that integer as the ID (e.g., a randomly generated integer ``1000" will be returned as ``$-$1000"). All the assigned IDs are maintained in a B$^{+}$-tree to speed up the dictionary lookup.

\subsubsection{Internal Processing Module}

Generally, the evaluation of SPARQL queries is based on pattern matching. In this system, we maintain in memory all six possible permutations of \emph{subject} (S), \emph{predicate} (P), and \emph{object} (O) in six separate indices in order to guarantee that every possible query pattern in a SPARQL query with variables in any position of a triple can be answered by only performing a single index scan. Specifically, these permutations are named as SPO, SOP, OSP, OPS, PSO, and POS indices, respectively. Notice that instead of the original URIs or literals, all the six indices here consist of integer IDs, which are assigned by the discriminative encoding component. This ID-based indexing scheme can both save memory space and accelerate join processing.

\subsubsection{Query Parser and Planner Module}

When Geo-Store receives a SPARQL query $q$, it parses $q$, identifies the IDs that have been assigned to the literals in $q$ according to SAM, and employs the retrieved IDs to replace the corresponding literals in $q$. By executing these processes, the subsequent evaluation of $q$ purely relies on the comparisons of IDs instead of the original literals. A query evaluation plan can then be generated accordingly.

\subsubsection{Dictionary Decoding Module}

After the SPARQL query is evaluated by the internal processing module, the dictionary decoding module transforms the resulting IDs back to their original literals as the query results. In Geo-Store, we employ a B$^{+}$-tree structure to implement this ID-to-literal mapping.
